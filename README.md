Code created in the context of the course called "Building AI"

My goal was to create a linear regression algorithm that finds the 3 closest neighbors. I used the library SkLearn

In this machine learning algorithm, I use two types of data sets: test sets and training sets

Training set gives information that enables the evolution of the AI method

Test set enables to validate that the program works correctly
